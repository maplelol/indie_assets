My name and Kadokawa either in a credit list in the game or in a Read-me file for credits.

Details:
The Custom - Stalls file is fully custom and doesn't require Kadokawa's accreditation for use. All other resources (bar the aforementioned Custom - Stalls file) can only be used in RPG Maker engines. 

If used commercially you must own a copy of RPG Maker 2003 and RPG Maker 2000 (both, as a lot of the graphics consist of edits of both and splicings of them together at times, too.)

If you do use these resources, send me a line letting me know. I like checking out projects.
