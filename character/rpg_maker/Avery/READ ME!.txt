Hello, this is Avery O/

Before you use my stuff you should know:
You need to own RMMV for everything besides the medusa face, which was drawn from scratch.

All credits go to Avery (and Kadokawa), you may use them in any non-commercial project, if you use them in a commercial one you have to send me a free copy instantly when it's out.
NO REPOST! NO POST OF EDITS! CREDITS MUST BE GIVEN!

The firecave was inspired by the one of the XP RTP.
The gates resemble the Gates from the MV titlescreen.
The medusa is inspired by the Ace Big Monster Medusa.
The Lamia resembled the one from the XP RTP.
The succubi are inspired by the VX Ace ones.
The water elemental has a similar design as the one from XP RTP.
The priestress is inspired by Ace RTP again.
